Kunena Pushalert
----------------

This is a [Joomla][3] plugin to push [Kunena][1] activities with the [Pushalert][2] REST-API to your users.

You need an [Pushalert][2] account and an api key.

At the moment, this is done for my needs. Maybe i publish it in joomla extensions directory in future. If you wanna give it a try, clone it and package all files in the kunena directory in a zip or tar.gz package. This can then be installed like other joomla packages.

Or get the latest from [releases][4].
